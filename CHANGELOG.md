# Changelog

All notable changes to **tdmcp** are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres
to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - 2026-05-26

Musical reactivity: turn audio and the beat into signals that drive visuals.

### Added

- **`extract_audio_features`** — build an audio-analysis chain that exposes ready-to-bind
  reactive channels (overall level plus bass/mid/treble band energies) on a Null CHOP, with
  a Sensitivity knob. Source can be the live device (mic/line), an audio file, a synthetic
  oscillator (for testing without device permission), or an existing CHOP.
- **`create_tempo_sync`** — a Beat CHOP clock driven by TouchDesigner's global tempo,
  exposing beat-synced channels (`ramp`, `pulse`, `count`, `beat`, `bar`, `bpm`). With
  `emit_events` on, a CHOP Execute DAT broadcasts a **`beat` event** over the bridge
  WebSocket on every beat, so `tdmcp-agent watch` and the AI can react to the pulse live.
- **`bind_to_channel`** — the link that makes a visual react: drive any node parameter from
  a CHOP channel (an audio feature or a beat channel) by expression, with a scale and offset.
  Wires `extract_audio_features` / `create_tempo_sync` into a visual system.
- **`beat_reactive_designer` prompt** — guides the assistant through building the reactive
  chain and mapping audio features / the beat onto a visual system's parameters.
- **CLI commands** `audio-features`, `tempo-sync` and `bind` for the above.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-26

Developer experience and a scriptable CLI: drive the whole toolset from a shell, stream
live events, and take undo points before risky edits.

### Added

- **`reload_bridge`** — hot-reload the bridge's Python inside the running TouchDesigner so
  edits under `td/` take effect without reopening the project (also `tdmcp-agent reload`).
- **`manage_checkpoint`** — store / restore / list / delete a full snapshot of a
  sub-network (an "undo point"). A checkpoint captures every node's constant parameters,
  the wiring and node positions; restoring reapplies parameters, recreates nodes deleted
  since (with their wiring) and prunes nodes created since. Complements `manage_presets`
  (which captures custom-parameter looks for performance) by snapshotting the whole network.
- **CLI `preview`** — capture a TOP straight to a PNG file (`-o/--out`).
- **CLI `watch`** — stream TouchDesigner bridge events (`node.created`, `node.cook`,
  `timeline.frame`, …) as ndjson until interrupted; `--include-high-frequency` opts into
  the per-frame events.
- **CLI: full Layer-1/Layer-2 coverage** — the agent now exposes the high-level generators
  and building blocks, not just Layer-3 CRUD: `visual`, `feedback`, `generative`,
  `particles`, `audio-reactive`, `dataviz`, `post-fx`, `output`, `plan`, plus `animate`,
  `arrange`, `connect`, `container`, `control-panel`, `io`, `glsl`, `chain`, `script`,
  `duplicate`, `component`, `preset`, `params` and `checkpoint`. Whole systems can now be
  scripted from a shell.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/Pantani/tdmcp/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-26

Live control: generated systems are now playable instruments, not just static renders.

### Added

- **`create_control_panel`** — append custom parameters (sliders, toggles, menus, RGB,
  pulse) to a COMP and bind them to node parameters, so a generated system gets real knobs.
- **`animate_parameter`** — drive one or more parameters over time with an LFO
  (sine/triangle/ramp/square/pulse/random) between a min and max — movement without manual
  keyframing.
- **`manage_presets`** — store / recall / list / delete named snapshots of a COMP's
  parameter values, saved in the COMP's storage so they persist with the project.
- **`create_external_io`** — bridge to the outside world: OSC input and MIDI input mapped
  straight to parameters (control surfaces), DMX/Art-Net output for lighting, and
  NDI / Syphon-Spout video input.
- **`manage_component`** — save any COMP as a reusable `.tox` file and load it back, as an
  independent copy or a live-linked instance.
- **Auto-exposed control panels** on the artist generators: `create_feedback_network`
  (Feedback), `create_particle_system` (Drag/Turbulence/Gravity/Lifetime),
  `create_generative_art` (Speed), `create_audio_reactive` (Sensitivity) and
  `create_data_visualization` (Scale). Every generator now arrives playable. Pass
  `expose_controls: false` to opt out.
- **Recipe `controls`** field — recipes can declare a control panel (bind targets use recipe
  node names; they are resolved to real paths on build), plus a new
  **`performable_feedback_tunnel`** recipe that ships with Feedback/Zoom/Spin/Blur knobs.
- **Recursive `get_td_performance`** — measures cook time across the whole sub-network
  (including nested generated containers), returns the slowest nodes first, and is recursive
  by default.

### Fixed

- `create_feedback_network`'s `feedback_gain` was a silent no-op (it set a non-existent
  `gain` parameter on a Level TOP); it now sets `brightness1`, so the loop actually decays.
