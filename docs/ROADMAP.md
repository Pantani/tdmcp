# tdmcp Roadmap — v0.3.0 → v1.0.0

A phased plan toward 1.0. Each phase ships as its own minor release with a
CHANGELOG entry and live validation in TouchDesigner. Phases are ordered by
**technical dependency + impact on live audiovisual / VJ workflows** (audio-,
camera- and beat-reactive performance).

> **Status legend:** ☐ planned · ◐ in progress · ☑ shipped
> **Effort legend:** **S** ≤1 day · **M** 2–4 days · **L** ~1 week

## Cross-cutting conventions

Every feature follows the existing patterns:

- New tool in `src/tools/layerN/<name>.ts` — Zod schema + `*Impl` + `register*`,
  registered in the layer's `index.ts`.
- Bridge work happens via a Python script built with `buildPayloadScript`
  (`__PAYLOAD_B64__`) executed through the bridge, parsed back with
  `parsePythonReport`. New REST endpoints / services only when streaming or
  performance demands it.
- CLI commands map 1:1 onto a tool handler in `src/cli/agent.ts`.
- Unit test in `tests/unit`; live-validate in TD (preview + post-cook error
  check) before marking shipped.
- CHANGELOG entry per release (Keep a Changelog + SemVer).

## Phase overview

---

## Phase 0 — v0.3.0 · DX & CLI foundation ☑ shipped

First because it has a multiplier effect: hot-reload kills the bridge-staleness
pain, and the event producer is a prerequisite for musical reactivity.

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bridge hot-reload | `reload_bridge` tool + `reload` CLI reimport `mcp.*` in place (logic already in `dev.py`) | S | ☑ |
| Bridge event producer | `timeline.frame` / `node.cook` / `project.saved` broadcast — already shipped in the bridge's `events_hook` Execute DAT | M | ☑ |
| CLI: expose L1/L2 | All generators + building blocks in `agent.ts` (`visual`, `audio-reactive`, `post-fx`, `preset`, `animate`, `io`, `checkpoint`, …) | M | ☑ |
| CLI `watch` | `runWatch` tails the bridge WebSocket as ndjson (`--include-high-frequency`) | S | ☑ |
| CLI `preview` | `preview <nodePath> -o file.png` writes the PNG to disk | S | ☑ |
| Checkpoint / restore | `manage_checkpoint` (store/restore/list/delete): params + topology, recreate deleted, prune created | M | ☑ |

**Areas:** `td/modules/mcp/dev.py` (already had reload), `src/cli/agent.ts`
(`runWatch`, preview, L1/L2 commands), `src/tools/layer3/reloadBridge.ts`,
`src/tools/layer2/manageCheckpoint.ts`. The bridge itself was unchanged — the
event producer and reload logic already shipped in 0.2.0, so no reinstall needed.

---

## Phase 1 — v0.3.0 · Musical reactivity ⭐ ☑ shipped

The heart of the live workflow. Beat events ride the phase-0 event producer.

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `extract_audio_features` | Audio chain exposing level + bass/mid/treble band energies on a Null CHOP, with a Sensitivity knob; device/file/oscillator/existing source | M | ☑ |
| `create_tempo_sync` | Beat CHOP clock → `ramp`/`pulse`/`count`/`beat`/`bar`/`bpm`; emits a `beat` event over the WebSocket each beat (via a CHOP Execute DAT) | M | ☑ |
| `bind_to_channel` | The link: drive any parameter from a CHOP channel (audio feature / beat) by expression, with scale + offset | M | ☑ |
| Prompt "beat-reactive designer" | Guides the AI to wire audio features + beat into a visual's parameters | S | ☑ |

**Areas:** `src/tools/layer1/extractAudioFeatures.ts`,
`src/tools/layer1/createTempoSync.ts`, `src/tools/layer2/bindToChannel.ts`,
`src/prompts/beatReactiveDesigner.ts`, CLI commands `audio-features` /
`tempo-sync` / `bind`. Notes from the live probe: this build has **no Tempo
CHOP** (the Beat CHOP is the clock) and the bass/mid/treble split uses Audio
Filter → Analyze (RMS) rather than the spectrum. `bind_to_channel` was added as
the missing link that actually wires reactive signals into visuals.

---

## Phase 2 — v0.3.0 · Live performance ⭐ ☑ shipped

Turns generated systems into instruments. Builds on the preset/control-panel/external-I/O work.

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `manage_cue` (scene system) | Store/recall/list/delete cues + a timed, eased **morph** crossfade between looks (Execute DAT engine) | L | ☑ |
| `create_macro` | One 0–1 knob → N parameters, each remapped into its own range with a curve | M | ☑ |
| `randomize_controls` | Randomize numeric controls within range, with an `amount` blend (nudge → full scramble) | S | ☑ |
| `create_control_surface` | Playable panel COMP: faders that drive params + buttons that recall/morph cues | M | ☑ |
| `create_phone_remote` | Mobile web panel served from a Web Server DAT — touch sliders, no app to install | M | ☑ |
| OSC/MIDI output | `osc_out` / `midi_out` in `create_external_io` for bidirectional feedback | S | ☑ |

**Areas:** new L2 tools (`manageCue`, `createMacro`, `randomizeControls`,
`createControlSurface`, `createPhoneRemote`), extended `createExternalIo`, CLI
commands `cue`/`macro`/`randomize`/`surface`/`remote`. Note: "MIDI learn" is
covered declaratively — wiggle a control, read the input CHOP with `get_td_nodes`,
then `bind_to_channel` — rather than an interactive capture mode.

---

## Phase 3 — v0.3.0 · Advanced creation (TouchDesigner) ☑ shipped

Heavy but mutually independent creation tools — each builds, verifies and previews a network.

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_video_player` | Movie File In, or a playlist via a Switch TOP, with Play/Speed/Clip controls | M | ☑ |
| `create_layer_mixer` | A/B Cross TOP (Crossfade knob) or composite blend modes; sources via Select TOPs | M | ☑ |
| `create_3d_scene` | Geometry + Camera + Light + Render TOP (sphere/box/grid) with RotateY/Zoom | L | ☑ |
| `create_projection_mapping` | Corner Pin warp with draggable handles, output for setup_output | L | ☑ |
| `create_keyframe_animation` | Keyframed curve (time/value, easing) looping in sync — choreographed motion | M | ☑ |
| `create_simulation` | reaction_diffusion (recipe) + slime/fluid feedback flow fields, Decay knob | L | ☑ |

**Areas:** new L1 tools (`createLayerMixer`, `createVideoPlayer`, `create3dScene`,
`createProjectionMapping`, `createKeyframeAnimation`, `createSimulation`), CLI
commands `mixer`/`video`/`scene3d`/`mapping`/`keyframe`/`simulation`. Note:
"more recipes" is folded into these generators (they are the creation primitives);
`create_simulation` reuses the existing `reaction_diffusion` recipe, and
`create_generative_art` already covers cellular-automata / flow-field / attractor
techniques.

---

## Phase 4 — v0.3.0 · Intelligence (AI) ☑ shipped

The intelligence layer on top of everything already built.

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Visual reference → network | `image_to_visual` prompt — recreate a reference image's look in real nodes (multimodal) | L | ☑ |
| Natural-language tweaks | `tweak_visual` prompt — "darker/faster/more chaotic" → the right params | M | ☑ |
| Operator KB search | `search_operators` — relevance-ranked keyword search over the 629 operators (no embedding dependency) | M | ☑ |
| Aesthetic critique | `critique_visual` prompt — evaluates preview/topology/perf, proposes concrete fixes | M | ☑ |
| Patch doc / diagram | `document_network` — counts by family/type + a Mermaid flowchart of the real network | S | ☑ |
| Remaining prompts | `vj_set_builder` and `fix_shader` | S | ☑ |

**Areas:** `src/tools/layer3/searchOperators.ts` & `documentNetwork.ts`,
`src/prompts/` (image_to_visual, tweak_visual, critique_visual, vj_set_builder,
fix_shader), CLI commands `operators` / `document`. Note: "semantic" search is
relevance-ranked keyword matching over the KB rather than a heavyweight embedding
index; multimodal / natural-language / critique ship as prompts (the model already
sees images and the patch) instead of bespoke tools.

---

## Phase 5 — v0.3.0 · Robustness & export ☑ shipped

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `render_output` | Save a TOP to disk at full resolution (PNG/JPG/EXR/TIFF) — export a finished frame | M | ☑ |
| `optimize_performance` | Rank cook-time bottlenecks with suggestions; apply:true lowers flagged TOPs' resolution | M | ☑ |
| `diff_snapshots` | Readable diff between two snapshots — nodes/connections/params added, removed, changed | M | ☑ |
| `list_recipes` / `apply_recipe` | Browse and instantiate the recipe library from a tool/CLI | M | ☑ |
| Keyboard / gamepad / mouse input | `keyboard_in` / `gamepad_in` / `mouse_in` in `create_external_io` | S | ☑ |

**Areas:** new L3 tools (`renderOutput`, `optimizePerformance`, `diffSnapshots`),
L1 (`listRecipes`, `applyRecipe`), extended `createExternalIo`, CLI commands
`render`/`optimize`/`diff`/`recipes`/`recipe`. Follow-ups (Unreleased) finished the
items deferred during the build: `record_movie` (movie/sequence beyond a single
frame), a show scaffold (`scaffold_show` / CLI `init`), an interactive CLI `repl`,
GPU instancing in `create_3d_scene`, and an opt-in `semantic` re-rank for
`search_operators` via the LLM endpoint (keyword stays the zero-config default).

---

## Phase 6 — v0.3.0 · Obsidian vault integration ◐ integrated (live-validation pending)

Bridges an Obsidian vault (a folder of markdown notes) and TouchDesigner, gated on
`TDMCP_VAULT_PATH`. The vault layer is `src/vault/`; tools live in `src/tools/vault/`.

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Vault infra | `src/vault/` (path-traversal-safe IO + frontmatter), `TDMCP_VAULT_PATH`, `ToolContext.vault` | S | ☑ |
| Recipes ↔ vault | `RecipeLibrary` merges `<vault>/Recipes/*.md`; `save_recipe_to_vault` captures a live network | M | ☑ |
| `apply_shader_from_vault` | Build a GLSL TOP from a fenced-`glsl` note | S | ☑ |
| `sync_presets_vault` | Export/import `manage_presets` snapshots as markdown | S | ☑ |
| `export_network_to_vault` | Mermaid + `[[wikilink]]` patch-map note | S | ☑ |
| `log_performance` | Dated show diary with snapshot + thumbnail | S | ☑ |
| `import_setlist` | Build a show from a setlist note's `tracks` | M | ☑ |
| `bind_vault_text` | Text DAT live-synced to a vault note | S | ☑ |
| `generate_from_moodboard` | Seed `create_generative_art` from a palette/mood note | S | ☑ |
| `scaffold_vault` | Write a starter vault layout with worked examples | S | ☑ |

**Areas:** `src/vault/{index,frontmatter}.ts`, `src/recipes/markdown.ts`,
`src/tools/vault/*`, `TDMCP_VAULT_PATH` in `src/utils/config.ts`. Offline-tested
(vitest); live TD validation pending. Depends on `gray-matter` for frontmatter.

---

## v1.0.0 — Consolidation

Tool-API stabilization, docs (README + per-feature), test coverage, expanded
recipe library, bridge hardening.

---

## Phase 7 — v0.3.0 · Stage I/O & sensor reactivity ☑ shipped

Features resume after the 1.0 stabilization milestone. The completed phases make
a system *play*; this phase makes it survive a real venue: get the signal **out**
to the rig, spread it across **multiple projectors**, react to the **camera** (not
just audio), lock to the **DJ's clock**, and keep running **hands-free**. It stays
clear of the parallel tracks — nothing here touches the Obsidian vault (markdown
knowledge) or the local-LLM copilot (`tdmcp chat`).

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Video **output** | ~~`ndi_out` / `syphon_out` / `spout_out`~~ — **already shipped**: `setup_output` covers `ndi` / `syphon_spout` / `window` / `record` / `touch_out`. (A `video_device_out` for SDI/capture-card hardware is the only gap; deferred as niche.) | — | ☑ |
| `create_motion_reactive` (L1) | Camera/video-in → frame-to-frame **motion** energy + **brightness** on a Null CHOP, with a Sensitivity knob — the **camera** counterpart to `extract_audio_features`, ready for `bind_to_channel`. A Cache TOP holds the previous frame, a Difference + Analyze reduce it, and an Execute DAT keeps the chain live. (Optical flow is unsupported on macOS, so direction isn't exposed.) | L | ☑ |
| `sync_external_clock` (L1) | Drive the project's **global tempo** (`op('/').time.tempo`) from a Bpm knob + a Tap pulse (beat-match the DJ by ear), so every Beat CHOP — `create_tempo_sync`, `create_autopilot` — follows. Complements `create_tempo_sync` (validated live). A dedicated **MIDI-clock / Ableton-Link** sync is a noted follow-up (needs hardware to validate) | M | ☑ |
| `create_multi_output` (L1) | Fan a master TOP across N projectors/displays — a cropped horizontal/vertical slice per output (resized to full projector res, ended on a Null), with optional borderless Window COMPs offset across the desktop. An `overlap` adds **edge-blending**: tiles widen into their neighbours and a GLSL feather fades the shared seams for soft-edge projector blending. Builds on `setup_output` (validated live, feather included) | L | ☑ |
| `create_text_overlay` (L1) | A styled **Text TOP** (font size / hex color / h+v alignment) composited 'over' a source through a Composite TOP, or standalone on a transparent background — lyrics, titles, credits. Distinct from the vault's `bind_vault_text` (which data-syncs a Text *DAT* to a note); this is a finished visual layer (validated live) | M | ☑ |
| `create_autopilot` (L1) | A beat-driven **auto-VJ**: a Beat CHOP + CHOP Execute DAT that every N beats randomizes a target COMP's controls (by `amount`) or cycles its stored cues, for hands-free improvisation, with live Active/Beats/Amount knobs (reuses the tempo clock + `randomize_controls` + `manage_cue`). A live runtime engine, unlike the vault's static `import_setlist` build (validated live) | M | ☑ |

**Why these, why now:** they reuse primitives already shipped — `create_external_io`
gains output kinds, `create_motion_reactive` mirrors `extract_audio_features` and
plugs into `bind_to_channel`, `sync_external_clock` feeds the existing Beat CHOP,
`create_autopilot` orchestrates `manage_cue`/`randomize_controls` on the beat event.
No new bridge endpoints expected (Execute-DAT + `buildPayloadScript` patterns suffice).

**Probe-first risks (validate live before committing to the API):**

- **Syphon/Spout/NDI out** are platform- and license-dependent operators — confirm
  the TOP types exist in this build (`syphonspoutoutTOP`, `ndioutTOP`, `videodeviceoutTOP`)
  before shaping the schema; gate per-OS like the existing input kinds.
- **External MIDI clock → tempo**: verify whether tempo can be driven from a MIDI
  Beat/clock signal in this build, or whether tap-tempo (timed pulses → BPM) is the
  reliable path. (Earlier probing already established there is **no Tempo CHOP** — the
  Beat CHOP is the clock — so this likely drives the Beat CHOP's BPM via a small
  Execute/CHOP-Execute DAT.)
- **Camera capture** can hang TD on a macOS permission modal (known gotcha) — default
  `create_motion_reactive` to a movie/file or synthetic source for zero-permission
  testing, exactly as `extract_audio_features` offers an oscillator source.

**Candidate CLI:** `io --params '{"kind":"ndi_out",…}'` (existing command, new kind),
`motion-reactive`, `clock-sync`, `multi-output`, `text`, `autopilot`.

---

## Phases 8–11 — v0.3.0 · Effects, reactivity, control & AI ◐ integrated (live-validation pending)

Built as parallel waves (one subagent per feature — new files + offline `msw` unit tests only, no
registry edits — then integrated single-writer) alongside Phase 7. Each ships as a new tool + CLI
command + unit tests, all green offline (104 unit tests). **Live TD validation + per-feature tuning
is the remaining step** (each build flagged its own ⚠ live-tuning unknown), following the
repo's parallel feature-build workflow.

### Phase 8 — Signature VJ effects ⭐
| Feature | Delivers | CLI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_strobe` | Beat-syncable strobe/flash (square LFO → brightness expression) | `strobe` | ◐ |
| `create_kaleidoscope` | N-fold radial mirror (self-contained GLSL polar-fold) | `kaleidoscope` | ◐ |
| `create_glitch` | RGB-shift (GLSL) + noise displacement, non-device default | `glitch` | ◐ |
| `create_kinetic_text` | Animated / beat-flashed lyric typography (flash/pulse/slide) | `kinetictext` | ◐ |

### Phase 9 — Deeper musical reactivity ⭐
| Feature | Delivers | CLI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_spectrum` | N-band FFT (Audio Spectrum CHOP → resample → per-band Null) | `spectrum` | ◐ |
| `detect_onsets` | kick/snare/hat transients (RMS → moving baseline → threshold) + `onset` events | `onsets` | ◐ |
| `create_waveform` | Time-domain oscilloscope (trail → CHOP-to-TOP) | `waveform` | ◐ |

### Phase 10 — Creation & content
| Feature | Delivers | CLI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_color_grade` | Lift/gamma/gain + saturation/hue + optional LUT | `colorgrade` | ◐ |
| `import_model` | 3D model file → Geo/Camera/Light/Render (primitive fallback) | `model` | ◐ |
| `create_shader_lib` | Curated GLSL pack (tunnel/raymarch/fractal/metaballs/plasma) | `shaderlib` | ◐ |
| `create_video_synth` | Analog-synth lissajous/interference/scanline patterns | `videosynth` | ◐ |
| `create_depth_silhouette` | Silhouette/body mask from depth/video (device-free default) | `silhouette` | ◐ |

### Phase 11 — Live control, AI & DX
| Feature | Delivers | CLI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_panic` | Instant Blackout + Freeze safety control | `panic` | ◐ |
| `create_clip_launcher` | Ableton-style cue-trigger button grid (reuses `manage_cue`) | `launcher` | ◐ |
| `text_to_shader` / `audio_to_show` / `auto_fix` | AI prompts: author GLSL, plan a set, repair loop | — | ◐ |
| `tdmcp doctor` | Environment diagnostic (bridge / LLM / vault / config) | `doctor` | ◐ |

### Wave 6 — refinements + the deferred tracks ◐ integrated (two experimental)

| Feature | Delivers | CLI | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_waveform` refine | Real scope LINE (CHOP-to-SOP → Geo → ortho Render TOP); ⚠ vertical deflection (SOP `P(1)` attribute mapping) needs live tuning | `waveform` | ◐ |
| `create_kinetic_text` refine | Flash modulates alpha (text vanishes, not black) | `kinetictext` | ☑ |
| `create_external_io` outputs | `rtmp_out` (Video Stream Out) + `artnet_out` (DMX Out CHOP → Art-Net/sACN) | `io` | ◐ |
| `bind_to_channel` smoothing | attack/release/smooth Lag-CHOP envelope follow | `bind` | ◐ |
| `manage_cue` quantize | recall/morph snapped to the next beat/bar | `cue` | ◐ |
| `create_decks` | A/B decks + master crossfader + per-deck gain | `decks` | ◐ |
| `detect_pitch` | FFT-argmax monophonic pitch (Hz/note) — **experimental**: reads 0 with the default threshold, needs live tuning | `pitch` | ◐ |
| `learn_control` | MIDI/OSC snapshot→diff→bind — **experimental** (live-stateful) | `learn` | ◐ |

**Still deferred:** dedicated MIDI-clock / Ableton-Link tempo sync (needs hardware); full live
tuning of `detect_pitch` (threshold/argmax) and `learn_control` (noise-reject diff); and
`create_waveform`'s amplitude→Y deflection (the SOP attribute-scope detail).

---

## Phase 12 — v0.3.0 · Dimensional: 3D, depth & spatial mapping ☑ shipped

Takes visuals **off the flat plane**: react in 3D, sculpt with depth, and map onto real-world
surfaces — the terrain of installations and dimensional VJ work. Today 3D is only basic
(`create_3d_scene`, `import_model`) and mapping is flat (`projection_mapping` corner-pin,
`create_multi_output` tiling). This phase builds on mechanisms already validated live this cycle —
GPU **instancing** (`create_3d_scene`), **GLSL TOP** masks (the `create_multi_output` edge-blend),
and per-point attribute displacement (`pscale`). It stays clear of the parallel waves (8–11) and the
vault track — nothing here overlaps their 2D effects / audio / creation tools (`import_model` loads
a model; `create_depth_silhouette` makes a flat mask — both distinct from the 3D geometry below).

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `create_3d_audio_reactive` (L1) | A 3D scene that reacts to sound: `instanced_bars` — a row of boxes/spheres whose **per-bar height** tracks the FFT (one CHOP sample per bar drives `instancesy`), a 3D spectrum bar-graph — or `bass_pulse`, a single primitive that swells with RMS energy. The 3D counterpart to `create_audio_reactive` | M | ☑ |
| `create_dome_output` (L1) | GLSL-remap a source to **fisheye / equirectangular** for planetarium domes / 360 — the curved single-output complement to `create_multi_output`'s flat tiling | M | ☑ |
| `create_mesh_warp` (L1) | Map a source onto a **curved surface** via a deformable textured grid — a Point-SOP Z deform (bulge / wave / cylinder) of a `gridSOP`, textured through a Constant MAT, beyond the flat corner-pin. Output for `setup_output` | L | ☑ |
| `create_depth_displacement` (L1) | Push a plane into 3D by a **depth / luminance map** (camera / video / synthetic) via a **GLSL MAT** vertex stage — real 2.5D relief geometry. Distinct from `create_depth_silhouette` (a flat mask). Includes the cold-cook keep-alive | M | ☑ |
| `create_gpu_particle_field` (L1) | A high-count **GPU particle field** (side² up to 512²) — position/velocity **feedback-TOP** loops (curl-noise / gravity) feeding **TOP-instancing**, flowing as curl-noise streams. Beyond the CPU `create_particle_system` | L | ☑ |

**Live-validation findings** (built create → verify → preview against TouchDesigner 2025.32820; each `*Impl` exercised end-to-end through the agent CLI against the live bridge):

- `create_3d_audio_reactive`: per-bar height needs a **CHOP instance source** (channels `tx`/`sy`), not an `instancesy` expression — a per-instance expression evaluates only once. The merge needs `align="start"` or the bins rotate. `bass_pulse` uses Analyze CHOP `function="rmspower"` (not `"rms"`, which silently falls back to a ~0 average).
- `create_dome_output`: GLSL fisheye/equirect remap of an existing (ideally equirectangular) source renders a valid dome master; a true cube-map render is the higher-fidelity follow-up.
- `create_mesh_warp`: the Point SOP's `tz` is a per-point expression (`me.inputPoint`) — no `dopos` toggle exists. Camera tilted off head-on so the curvature reads in preview; `constantMAT.colormap` textures the grid.
- `create_depth_displacement`: GLSL MAT par names are `vdat`/`pdat`/`sampler0top`/`sampler0name` + the `vec` uniform sequence; named samplers must be **declared** in the shader (`uniform sampler2D sHeight;`) and `P` is `vec3`.
- `create_gpu_particle_field`: TOP-instancing maps texel `r`/`g`/`b` → XYZ and derives the count from the texture (validated), but applies translate **only** — particle size must live on the dot SOP's radius, not per-instance scale. Audio/motion reactivity is wired end-to-end: an RMS (audio) or frame-difference (motion) analysis drives the velocity shader's `uReact` uniform by expression, energising the field with the signal (validated by forcing the uniform).

**Areas:** new L1 tools `create3dAudioReactive`, `createDomeOutput`, `createMeshWarp`,
`createDepthDisplacement`, `createGpuParticleField` (each `*Impl` + `register*` + msw unit test),
registered in `src/tools/layer1/index.ts`; CLI commands `audio3d` / `dome` / `mesh-warp` /
`depth-displace` / `gpu-particles` in `src/cli/agent.ts`. Built one-subagent-per-feature
(new files + offline tests only), then single-writer wiring + live tuning. The tool registry is now
119 tools (56 Layer 1).

**Stretch / hardware- or model-blocked (won't ship unvalidated):** depth-camera input
(Kinect / RealSense / Azure) in `create_external_io`; pose / body tracking (MediaPipe / ML) →
skeleton-driven visuals; real-time AI generation (StreamDiffusion). All need a sensor, an ML
component, or GPU+models to validate live.

**macOS note:** the five core features are pure-GPU render / GLSL / file-or-camera sourced, so each
is testable on the dev machine (unlike optical flow or depth sensors, which this build/OS can't
validate).

## Phase 13 — v0.5.0 · Components, agent-DX & reactivity ☑ shipped

> **Released in v0.5.0** (2026-05-29). The per-row ◐ below is the historical integration
> state at build time; the release shipped these tools (any remaining live-validation
> caveats are called out inline).

**v0.4.0 shipped 2026-05-27** — fifteen new tools/prompts (raymarch & particle-flock generators,
point-cloud/PBR/cubemap-dome, tempo detection, LED/palette/cue/dashboard, generative audio, and
recipe/style prompts). Body/pose tracking (`setup_body_tracking`, `create_pose_tracking`,
`create_pose_skeleton`, `create_body_reactive`) is also already on `main` (in-tree, **not** in the
0.4.0 CHANGELOG). Phase 13 is integrated for **v0.5.0**: the thesis shifts from *generating* visuals (0.4.x already covers that,
175 tools) to **packaging, documenting and cheaply operating** them. tdmcp already ships `.tox`
save/load (`manage_component`); v0.5.0 completes the *reusable-component* story (custom parameters +
extensions) and adds the analysis + agent-DX gaps no competing TD-MCP owns.
Benchmarked against the two leaders: **`8beeeaaat/touchdesigner-mcp`** (~330★,
node-CRUD only, no component packaging) and **`dylanroscover/Embody`** (~111★, the only one with
network-as-JSON + git-diffable externalization). dotsimulate **LOPs** is orthogonal (a 60+-operator
agent runtime *inside* TD, incl. its own MCP Server + "Claude Code" operators), so TDMCP stays
**agent-side** and, for AI generation, *drives* existing `.tox`es rather than reimplementing them.
Sourced from `research/touchdesigner-insane-tutorials-2026-05.md` (BL-01…BL-22) + a focused
Embody/dotsimulate deep-dive.

**Priority:** **P0** = component reusability (custom params + extensions) + Link/MIDI · **P1** =
project intelligence + the token-cheap agent-DX primitives · **P2** = self-documentation niceties +
perform mode. Table is ordered by priority. (3D/sim/particle generators shipped in 0.4.0; body
tracking is on `main` in-tree, not in the 0.4.0 CHANGELOG.)

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`export_component` / `import_component`~~ — **already shipped** | `.tox` `save` / `loadTox` / live-linked `externaltox` already exist as **`manage_component`** (BL-01 was a false gap). Remaining gap: a self-contained, dependency-collected portable bundle — note `saveExternalTox` only externalizes to a folder tree, not a single portable `.tox` (→ v0.6.0 `make_portable_tox`) | — | ☑ |
| `scaffold_extension` | Extension DAT stub + Extension Object + Promote flag + re-init — make a COMP scriptable (BL-03) | M | ◐ |
| `add_custom_parameters` | Declarative custom-parameter pages (`appendCustomPage`/`appendFloat…`), TDJSON in/out — expose knobs (BL-03) | M | ◐ |
| `sync_external_clock` + Link/MIDI | Add `ableton_link` + `midi_clock` modes alongside tap-tempo — lock to the DJ's clock (BL-08); Link/MIDI device paths still need live hardware validation | S | ◐ ⚠ |
| Body tracking ✅ on `main` (in-tree) | `setup_body_tracking` / `create_pose_tracking` / `create_pose_skeleton` / `create_body_reactive` (+ recipes `mediapipe_body_dots`, `pose_skeleton_mediapipe`) are in-tree on `main` (not in the 0.4.0 CHANGELOG). Remaining (incremental): hand/face modes, more reactive templates, live webcam validation (BL-02) | — | ☑ |
| `analyze_project` | Unused/dead ops, broken file deps, orphan COMPs, dependency graph via `findChildren`/connectors (BL-04) | M | ◐ |
| `generate_readme` | Markdown project doc: params table (TDJSON), I/O, child inventory, deps, preview thumbnail (BL-04) | M | ◐ |
| `analyze_screenshot` | Prompt+tool: `get_preview` image + topology + `get_td_node_errors` → explain/diagnose ("why is it black?") (BL-09) | M | ◐ |
| `edit_dat_content` | Surgical `old_string`/`new_string` DAT edit (unique-match + opt-in `replace_all`) — token-cheap edits *(Embody-mined)* | S | ◐ |
| `set_dat_content` (anti-wipe) | Safe whole-DAT write with a `confirm_wipe` guardrail (refuses silent clears) *(Embody-mined)* | S | ◐ |
| `batch_operations` | Many create/connect/set-param in one bridge round-trip, fail-forward with per-item warnings — expose the Layer-1 builder as a primitive *(Embody-mined)* | M | ◐ |
| `snapshot_td_graph` compact mode | Token-optimized TDN-style read (type-default hoisting, expr/bind shorthand, inline short arrays) — Embody's `read_tdn` is ~20–90× cheaper than op-walks *(Embody-mined)* | M | ◐ |
| `manage_annotation` + enclosed ops | Agents add network boxes/comments + query ops enclosed by a box → self-documenting networks *(Embody-mined)* | S | ◐ |
| `write_agent_guide` | Emit a project-local `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` seeded with TDMCP operator conventions + render-coordinate rules *(Embody-mined)* | S | ◐ |
| `set_perform_mode` | Advisory live-show flag; built-in guard suppresses preview captures, and future tools can opt in before expensive work — VJ-critical *(Embody-mined)* | M | ◐ |

**Body tracking — on `main` (in-tree; not in the 0.4.0 CHANGELOG):** `setup_body_tracking`, `create_pose_tracking`,
`create_pose_skeleton`, `create_body_reactive` are registered in `src/tools/layer1/`, with recipes
`mediapipe_body_dots` and `pose_skeleton_mediapipe`. Remaining Phase-13 work on this track is
incremental: hand/face modes, more reactive templates, and live webcam validation
(create→verify→preview + post-cook error check).

**Areas:** new L2/L3 tools (`scaffoldExtension`, `addCustomParameters` — the reusable-component
complement to the existing `manageComponent`; `analyzeProject`, `generateReadme`, `editDatContent`, `setDatContent`,
`batchOperations`, `manageAnnotation`, `writeAgentGuide`), extended `syncExternalClock`
(Link/MIDI), extended `snapshotTdGraph` (compact mode), `analyze_screenshot` as a prompt+tool,
plus 1:1 CLI commands. Bridge work uses the existing `buildPayloadScript`/`parsePythonReport`
pattern — the TD Python API is fully documented (tox: `COMP.save`/`saveExternalTox`/`loadTox`/
`saveByteArray`; extensions: `mod('X').X(me)` + Promote; params: `appendCustomPage`; analysis:
`findChildren`/`inputConnectors`/`outputConnectors`; serialization: TDJSON). No new REST endpoints
expected. Reuse the vault's path-traversal-safe IO for all `.tox`/file writes.

**Deferred to v0.6.0+:** `control_diffusion` / `drive_streamdiffusion` + `connect_comfyui` (drive an
*installed* StreamDiffusionTD/ComfyUI `.tox`; need GPU/CUDA to live-validate — probe-first),
`serialize_network` / `rebuild_network` + `make_portable_tox` (git-diffable JSON round-trip),
TD process lifecycle + multi-instance routing (`manage_td_process` / `switch_instance`),
`run_bridge_tests`, `get_bridge_logs`, `register_custom_tool` (artist-defined tools, LOPs' Tool-DAT
idea agent-side), `caption_top`, depth-camera input (Kinect Azure / RealSense, hardware-gated),
`create_pose_reactive`, and the remaining advanced generators. Note 0.4.0 already shipped
`create_raymarch_scene` (SDF), `create_particle_flock` (boids) and `create_point_cloud`; still open: `create_gpu_fluid`, `create_optical_flow_particles`,
`create_vertex_displacement_mat`, `create_strange_attractor`, `create_pop_field`, `create_sdf_text`.
The recipe/template
**marketplace** stays v0.6.0+ (local-first via TD Palette + Obsidian vault, per the project's
local-first distribution model).

## Phases 14–15 — v0.5.0 · Live mixing, parameter fidelity & creative direction ☑ shipped

> **Released in v0.5.0** (2026-05-29); several items were hardened and validated live in
> **v0.6.0**. The per-row ◐ below is the historical build-time state (TD was offline during
> the build); the release shipped these tools.

The post-discovery feature wave (sourced from `_workspace/discovery/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`, reconciled
against the Phase-13 merge so already-shipped items were treated as validation/hardening rather than
rebuilt). Built as parallel
one-tool-per-agent waves with a single-writer integrator. **TouchDesigner was offline during the
build**, so all new tools/prompts are offline-gated (typecheck + build + Biome + vitest + recipes +
bridge tests) with live create→cook→preview validation **UNVERIFIED-pending** — each TD-touching tool
ships a `probe` block that surfaces the real TD API on first live run, and is fail-forward.

`create_pop_field` (POPs experimental + render path uncertain), and the device paths of
`create_midi_note_reactive` / `create_midi_map` (need real MIDI gear; the synthetic note source is
validatable offline).

`creative` generator tier; `get_td_info` bridge-staleness warning; `video_device_out`.

**Still deferred to v0.6.0+ (not built):** `install-client` per-OS config writers + `install-bridge
--verify` (need real per-client testing); `doctor --fix` auto-execution (start Ollama / pull / recopy
bridge); `watch --exec`, `preview --inline/--watch`, shell-completion generator, repl
history+completion, `chat --prompt`/`--read-only`; copilot conversation persistence / smarter handoff
/ voice; `model_import_fbx_usd`; `dmx_fixture_pipeline` (hardware), `gpu_fluid` /
`optical_flow_particles` (GPU/macOS), `richer_event_stream`, `run_bridge_tests`, and the recipe
marketplace. _(Several of these shipped in 0.6.0 — see Phase 16; the rest carry into Phase 17.)_

---

## Phase 16 — v0.6.0 · TouchDesigner-depth & library fidelity ☑ shipped {#phase-16}

**v0.6.0 shipped 2026-05-29** (GitHub `.mcpb` asset; npm caught up in **0.6.1**, 2026-05-30). The
first wave drawn from the 2026-05-29 discovery backlog (`_workspace/discovery/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md`):
**seven P0 features** that sharpen the bridge's read/write fidelity, promote the well-defined
raw-Python operations to **structured REST endpoints** that survive `TDMCP_BRIDGE_ALLOW_EXEC=0`
(the security-conscious venue config), and add two performance instruments plus a library
contact-sheet. The tool registry is now **179 tools**.

| Feature | Delivers | Effort | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `get_td_node_flags` + `node_detail` fidelity | Flags (bypass/render/display/lock/allowCooking/clone), index-aware `wires_in`, and position/comment/color in one read — fixes the #1 "why is it black?" blind spot. Same fields extended into `serialize_network` (back-compatibly) | S | ☑ |
| Structured bridge endpoints | `POST /api/connect` + `/disconnect`, `GET …/params?modes=true` + `PATCH …/params/<p>/mode`, `GET`/`PUT …/text`, and `GET /api/logs` (backed by an in-bridge **Error DAT**) — connect/param-mode/DAT-text/logs now survive exec-off; `connect_nodes`/`disconnect_nodes`/`read_parameter_modes`/`set_parameter_expression`/`edit_dat_content`/`set_dat_content`/`get_bridge_logs` rewired **endpoint-first with exec-fallback** | M | ☑ |
| `cook.error` / `error.cleared` events | Edge-triggered cook-error events off the bridge frame hook (vs the old frame%120 poll) — the live-recovery signal | M | ☑ |
| `create_modulators` | BPM-synced multi-LFO bank (sine/saw/noise, master Rate/Depth) on one Null — bind `mod_out` to any parameter to make a network breathe in time | M | ☑ |
| `create_look_bank` | Snapshot + A↔B-morph instrument: capture (morph-safe), store and recall named looks with an instant snap or a quantized timed morph, plus a live A↔B blend knob | M | ☑ |
| `generate_library_index` + preview thumbnails | Markdown contact-sheet of the vault; `save_recipe_to_vault` / `save_component_to_vault` capture a sibling `<stem>.png` (capture **never throws**) | S | ☑ |
| Parameter-mode fix | `set_parameter_expression` now actually flips into Expression/Bind mode (a latent `ParMode` `NameError` had silently dropped the mode change) — verified live | S | ☑ |

**Live validation:** all seven passed QA — four PR gates green (1614 tests, 15/15 recipes, 86 bridge
tests) and each feature's bridge logic validated live in TD; the live HTTP round-trip through the new
dispatcher is pending an end-to-end re-check after a bridge reinstall (acceptable per release policy).

**v0.6.1 (2026-05-30) — release hygiene:** npm catch-up (0.6.0 was GitHub-only — the workflow skips
`npm publish` without `NPM_TOKEN`), tool count corrected to **179**, the `set_parameter_expression`
exec-fallback mode-flip fix for older bridges, a structured-endpoint regression suite, and PT cookbook
parity.

**Security (Unreleased / PR #26):** `rebuild_network` no longer `eval()`s the operator-type string
(resolves by name off `td`, guarded by `isidentifier()`); the bridge adds a loopback `Host`-header
check (closes a DNS-rebinding gap); and package downloads are GitHub-pinned, HTTPS-only and
size-capped (SSRF/oversize hardening). Plus `.safeskillignore` to focus the SafeSkill scanner.

## Phase 17 — v0.7.0 → v0.11.0 · Composition, automation & intelligence ◐ in progress {#phase-17}

The next wave is sourced from **two discovery passes**: the 2026-05-29 round-1 backlog
(`_workspace/discovery/FEATURE_BACKLOG.md` — 77 items; its 7 P0s shipped in 0.6.0) and the
2026-05-30 round-2 *"beyond the backlog"* pass (`_workspace/discovery_beyond_20260530/FEATURE_BACKLOG_BEYOND.md`
— **63 net-new** items, 58 genuinely new). With the primitive set now mature (~179 tools), the durable
value has moved **up a level** — from *generating* visuals to **composing, automating and intelligently
operating** a show. Ordered by the `live-show` weighting profile; `probe-live` items validate in TD
before the schema locks.

### Delivery — the round-2 campaign (idempotent, 5 waves → 5 releases)

The round-2 *"beyond"* backlog (**66 buildable**: 2 shared-schema foundations + 64
features) is being implemented by the **`tdmcp-backlog-campaign`** harness — a resumable,
ledger-driven loop over the existing design→build→integrate→QA→release pipeline (see
CLAUDE.md → *"Harness: backlog campaign"*). The ledger
(`_workspace/campaign_beyond_20260530/ledger.json`, merge-safe) makes re-runs **idempotent**
(shipped work is never rebuilt, interrupted work resumes); a stuck tool is **quarantined**
rather than blocking its wave. Policy: **staged by priority, checkpoint after wave 1,
commit + push (no tag),** TD-connected before each build wave. The shared-schema
foundations (`setlist_schema`, `memory_note`, `llm_client` via `server_sampling_assist`,
`timer_primitive` via `create_scheduler`) are designed **once** and ship before their
consumers fan out.

| Wave | Release | Theme | Items | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | v0.7.0 | Live-show foundation + all P0 (incl. Top-12) | 16 | ◐ building — launched 2026-05-30 |
| 2 | v0.8.0 | Show automation + musical reactivity | 9 | ☐ planned |
| 3 | v0.9.0 | Intelligence + library trust | 10 | ☐ planned |
| 4 | v0.10.0 | TD-depth authoring + DX accelerators | 12 | ☐ planned |
| 5 | v0.11.0 | P2 tail (raw-reach builders, protocol gaps) | 19 | ☐ planned |

The P0/P1 tables below are the curated highlights; the **complete per-wave roster** lives in
the campaign ledger + `_workspace/campaign_beyond_20260530/WAVE_PLAN.md`. A few round-1
leftovers listed below (`caption_top`, `install_client_writers`, `create_test_pattern`) are
tracked separately from the round-2 ledger and slot into later waves.

### P0 — the live-thesis core (round-2) · wave 1 → v0.7.0 ◐ building

| Feature | Surface | Delivers | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `setlist_runner` | cli | Headless show driver: advance scenes by duration / beat-count / manual, firing the shipped cue + morph — **the one thing that runs an arranged set over time** | M |
| `create_auto_montage` | controls | Beat-quantized content cutting across N source TOPs (cut/dissolve/wipe, per-source weight) — the **#1 auto-VJ gap**; the instrument `auto_vj_director` has nothing to drive | M |
| `create_euclidean_sequencer` | controls | Bjorklund algorithmic-rhythm generation (K/N hits, rotation, per-step probability) — pattern *generation*, not the replay `create_beat_grid_sequencer` does | M |
| `create_preset_morph` | controls | True **N-way** weighted parameter-space blend ("live between four moods") — vs the shipped two-slot `create_look_bank` | M |
| `auto_tag_library_asset` | library | Derive tags / operator-family / difficulty / description from the captured `nodes[].type` via the KB — makes the whole library searchable **by default** (the keystone read) | M |
| `panic_blackout_hotkey` | cli | Instant top-level `tdmcp panic` / `blackout` (+ `--restore` / `--hold`), idempotent re-fire — a safety verb you can type under pressure | S |

### P1 — automation, intelligence & authoring (round-2 headliners + top still-open round-1) · waves 1–4

| Feature | Surface | Delivers | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server_sampling_assist` | ai | Adopt MCP `sampling` so every LLM-backed tool runs through the **connected agent's model** with zero local-Ollama setup — also unblocks round-1 `caption_top` / `copilot_vision` (needs a structured/image method on `src/llm/client.ts`) | M |
| `recall_similar_work` + `style_memory` | ai | RAG over the artist's **own** vault + a persistent cross-session aesthetic profile — "do it the way I did last time" (the dotsimulate-RAG parity gap) | M |
| `create_scene_timeline` | controls | Bar-timed song-mode arranger (scene list on a Timer playhead, beat-synced crossfades) — the in-TD sibling of `setlist_runner` | M |
| `compose_cue_list` | ai | Natural language → a built, fireable cue sequence — "drive the show with words" | M |
| `live_dashboard_tui` | cli | Always-on operator HUD (FPS / drops / GPU / rolling errors / beat) over SSH at front-of-house | M |
| `scene_scheduler` | cli | Wall-clock cron-lite (`at` / `every` → command/cue/setlist) for unattended installations | M |
| `lint_recipe_library` | library | CI-grade recipe linter (operator-existence via KB + reference integrity + id-collision) — today's validation is a schema-only parse, so a bad operator type ships green and dies in TD | M |
| `create_glsl_material` + `build_chop_chain` | td-depth | Author a GLSL **MAT** (3D surface shading) and composable CHOP-DSP chains feeding any `bind_to_channel` — two unwrapped authoring surfaces | M |
| `control_timeline_transport` | td-depth | Transport read/write (play/pause/seek/rate) over `me.time` — and self-diagnoses the paused-timeline "why is it dead?" false alarm | S |
| `caption_top` | ai | _(round-1)_ Preview → plain-text description (vision endpoint + histogram fallback) — the headless "is it alive?" primitive | M |
| `install_client_writers` + `doctor_fix_autoexec` | cli | _(round-1)_ `install-client --write` deep-merges the client MCP config; `doctor --fix` *executes* safe repairs — finishes the artist-easy install story | M |
| `create_test_pattern` | controls | _(round-1)_ Projector calibration/alignment generator (grid / bars / sweep / per-output #) — every show starts here | S |

### Cross-cutting prerequisites & themes

- **Time-based show-automation stack** — build on **one shared setlist/scene schema** (also shared
  with the vault `import_setlist`/`export_setlist_to_vault`): `create_scheduler` (td-depth Timer-CHOP
  primitive) → `create_scene_timeline` (controls, in-TD) ∥ `setlist_runner` (cli, headless) ∥
  `compose_cue_list` (ai, NL authoring). The single biggest unbuilt live-thesis lever.
- **`server_sampling_assist` + a structured/image method on `src/llm/client.ts`** — the shared
  prerequisite for `compose_cue_list`, `score_build`, `moodboard_to_system`, `reference_to_plan` and
  round-1's `caption_top`/`copilot_vision`; the one platform move that unblocks the whole AI-tool family.
- **The "do it my way" cluster** — `recall_similar_work` ⇄ `style_memory` ⇄ `learn_from_my_corpus`
  ⇄ `learn_conventions` over one `Memory/` vault note schema (ai owns the intelligence, library owns
  the folder convention).
- **Library trust foundation** — `provenance_stamp` (author/license/origin) + `checksum_and_verify_pack`
  (SHA-256 verify-on-install), both S, for USB/venue handoff.

### Still deferred (GPU / macOS / hardware / multi-instance-gated)

`create_gpu_fluid`, `create_optical_flow_particles` (GPU/macOS), `create_sdf_text`,
`create_strange_attractor`, `create_vertex_displacement_mat` (signature generators), hand/face
MediaPipe modes + `create_pose_reactive` (need a live webcam + ML), `manage_td_process` /
`switch_instance` (multi-TD lifecycle), StreamDiffusion / ComfyUI drivers (GPU/CUDA),
`sync_timecode` hardware genlock, and the recipe/template **marketplace** (stays local-first via
TD Palette + Obsidian vault, per the project's distribution model).

## Appendix — Full discovery backlog {#full-backlog}

Reproduced from the two discovery runs so the complete catalog survives in git (`_workspace/` is
gitignored — the source files would otherwise be lost). **Legend:** Priority **P0/P1/P2** · Effort
**S** ≤1 day / **M** 2–4 days / **L** ~1 week · Impact/Conf High/Med/Low · Novelty **NEW** /

#### B.6 · Cross-cutting (round-2)

Value that spans surfaces (kept once above under its best-fit surface; relationships explicit here):

- **Time-based show automation** — `create_scheduler` (td-depth primitive) → `create_scene_timeline`
  (controls) ∥ `setlist_runner` (cli) ∥ `compose_cue_list` (ai); share **one** setlist/scene schema.
- **`server_sampling_assist` + a structured/image method on `src/llm/client.ts`** — the shared
  prerequisite for `compose_cue_list`, `score_build`, `moodboard_to_system`, `reference_to_plan` and
  round-1's `caption_top`/`copilot_vision`; the platform move that runs them via the connected model.
- **"Do it my way" cluster** — `recall_similar_work` ⇄ `style_memory` ⇄ `learn_from_my_corpus`
  ⇄ `learn_conventions` over one `Memory/` vault note schema.
- **Morph at two altitudes** — `create_preset_morph` (live instrument) ⇄ `morph_pack` (saved asset).
- **Engine pipeline** — `create_engine_comp` (process) ⇄ a "compile for Engine" bake on `make_portable_tox`.
- **Library keystone** — `auto_tag_library_asset` feeds `library_lineage_graph`, `recall_similar_work` and `lint_recipe_library`.
